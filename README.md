## Introduction

The Möbius compiler is a cornerstone of the SAPHO project at NIPSCERN, aiming to push the boundaries of hardware optimization. The name Möbius reflects our commitment to creating a compiler that, much like the Möbius strip, represents an unending loop of innovation and efficiency.

The Möbius strip symbolizes continuous transformation and interconnection, reflecting the role of a compiler in transforming high-level code (C) into low-level code (ASM). Its property of having only one side and one edge represents the unification and continuity between these two languages.

## Features

- **Optimized for C+-:** Tailored to the specific requirements of the C+- language.
- **High Performance:** Enhances code execution speed and efficiency on hardware.
- **Scalability:** Supports scalable architectures for various hardware configurations.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Provides detailed error messages and debugging support.
- **Extensible:** Easily extendable to incorporate future enhancements and optimizations.

## Installation

To install Möbius, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
